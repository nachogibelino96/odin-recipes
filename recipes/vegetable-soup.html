    <p>     
    This <strong> Soup </strong> has become one of my most popular soup recipes and for good reason!
    <em> It’s healthy, it’s comforting and 1,000 times better than what you’ll get in a can!</em> 
    Full of flavor and so easy to make you can’t go wrong with a big warm bowl of vegetable soup.
    </p>
    <p>But...What will you need to get it? Here we go:</p>
    
    <!-- So, here we will test the ul command with some italic letter-->
    <ul><em>
        <li>2 Carrots.</li>
        <ul><li>No more, no less...</li></ul>
        <li> 1 Potatoe.</li>
        <li>2 Tomatoes.</li>
            <ul><li>Please, try to get some <strong>red</strong> tomatoes.</li></ul>
        <li> 1 Yellow Onion.</li>
        <li>...and finally, 1 garlick.</li>
    </em>

    </ul>
    <p >Now we have all we need, let's start that cooking! </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Start cutting all the vegetables. Don't cut your fingers, if you do so, your soup will turn into a <strong>meat</strong> and vegetable soup.</li>
        <li>Put all what you cut in a hot water.</li>
        <li>Enjoy yourself!</li>

    </ol>
